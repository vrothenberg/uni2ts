# Product Context: Uni2TS Financial Model Fine-Tuning for Multivariate OHLCV Data

## Problem
Financial time series forecasting is a challenging task due to the complex, non-stationary, and often noisy nature of the data. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle with the multivariate nature of financial data, where multiple related variables (like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) provide complementary information. Pre-trained time series models, like Moirai, offer a powerful foundation, but they need to be specialized to capture the specific patterns and dynamics of financial markets.

## Solution
By fine-tuning a pre-trained Moirai model on a large, high-quality dataset of multivariate OHLCV data, we aim to create a highly accurate forecasting model. This model will be tailored to the nuances of financial data, enabling more reliable predictions of future price movements. The solution includes:

- A comprehensive data preparation pipeline for OHLCV data, including handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- A specialized model configuration optimized for multivariate financial time series.
- A probabilistic forecasting approach that provides not just point predictions but also uncertainty estimates.
- A robust evaluation framework that assesses the model's performance using both statistical and practical metrics.

## User Experience
The primary users of this project are quantitative researchers, data scientists, and financial analysts who need to develop and evaluate time series forecasting models for financial applications. The desired experience is a streamlined and reproducible workflow that allows them to:

- Easily prepare custom financial datasets for use with the `uni2ts` library.
- Configure and launch fine-tuning experiments with minimal effort.
- Iterate on different model configurations and datasets to find the optimal solution.
- Have clear documentation of the process and project decisions.
- Generate probabilistic forecasts that can be used for risk assessment and decision-making.
- Visualize forecasts with confidence intervals to communicate results effectively.
