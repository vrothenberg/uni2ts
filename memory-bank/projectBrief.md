# Project Brief: Uni2TS Financial Model Fine-Tuning

## Project Name
Uni2TS Financial Model Fine-Tuning

## Objective
Fine-tune a pre-trained Moirai model from the `uni2ts` library on a large dataset of financial pricing information to create a specialized multivariate forecasting model.

## Scope
- Analyze the `uni2ts` repository to understand its mechanics for training and fine-tuning.
- Develop a data preparation pipeline for custom financial time series data stored in a Parquet data lake.
- Configure and run a fine-tuning experiment on a subset of the financial data.
- Establish a repeatable workflow for fine-tuning with different datasets and model configurations.

## Key Deliverables
- A data preparation script for financial time series.
- Hydra configuration files for the fine-tuning experiment.
- A well-documented process for fine-tuning models within this repository.
- A set of memory bank files to ensure project continuity.
